Assumptions:
Accurate and reliable historical pricing

Constaints:
Since the project is set to be complete at the end of the 2 week bootcamp, the project is confined to the usage of historical data, rather than live testing, as there is would be a strong lack of sample with only 2 weeks to test.
The project is also limited by information avaliable of stock prices, that can be accessible to the IB apis.
