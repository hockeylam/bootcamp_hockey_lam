## notes
The data has date time, which is hard to plot with, so i labeled them with days_sequence column, which is just another way of time sequence, 1 is the first day, 2 is the second, all the way to the end.

## box plot of volume
This tells me that most days volume is sitting at low, then there are outlier days that occur to the right, showing that some days have exceptional volume, i suspect these days have large price changes...

## scatterplots
Volume by time is largely random, but a noticable decrease around day series 450-650, which is ~300 - 100 days ago.

Closing price by time can be observed to be positively correlating, which makes sense considering the nature of the SPY

Volume by closing price shows that there is largely no relation, or a slight negative relation between the volume and price
