I ran the data given with the given functions to remove outliers with 

I first plotted the original data showing that most data is in the middle, and there are some dots far out from the rest. 

I decided to not include the outliers with windsoring, I wanted to have minimal effects of skewing by including the outliers, since there arent that many. In this case there are 3 negative outliers, and only 2 positive outliers, but since there is so little of them, there is a high chance that we have gotten these on a complete random chance, therefore, including them might compromise the integrity of the data.

Then I removed the outliers and plotted it again.

For the two options of sensitivity analysis, I chose to do that summary because it shows in good comparison my data before and after removing the outliers. Plus, I am not too familiar with linear regression so I want to spend some time figureing it out before I use it.
